# Zype iOS Template

This legacy open source app template is no longer supported by Zype. If you are looking to build streaming applications for OTT, we recommend using [Zype Apps Creator](https://www.zype.com/product/apps-creator) for the latest app building features and functionality. 

The app is built with Objective-C and the Zype API. 

## Prerequisites

```
A valid and current Zype account
XCode software
CocoaPods
Enrollment in the Apple Developer Program
```

## Installing

```
A detailed installation guide can be found in our [iOS app publishing recipe](https://github.com/zype/zype-ios/blob/master/RECIPE.md). High level steps include:
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Run pod install to install all dependencies
3. Open the workspace 
4. Click build and run
5. Configure app settings to match your Zype property app keys and other desired toggles
```
